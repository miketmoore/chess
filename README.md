## Artwork WIP

I am drawing a set of chess pieces for this game. You can follow my progress on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/miketmoore/albums/72157693792363695).

## Contribute

I intentionally disabled the issues feature for this repository. This is a side project, so my time is limited. I am open to contributions, but ask that you contact me directly, via email or twitter if you want to discuss ideas or if you have questions. If you see something obvious or just want to write some code, feel free to submit a pull request without contacting me first. We can use the PR as a vehical for discussion.
